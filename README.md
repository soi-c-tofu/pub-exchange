# Pub Exchange

Pub exchange involves tracking seating avaliability to help customer pre-book table(s). Customers will be able to view number of seats available for the table and pre order food and drinks after booking table is confirmed. Based on existing pub apps which ask for customer(s) which table they are seating at after arrival, customer(s) may face a problem upon arrival that all tables are booked, customer(s) can use Pub Exchange to decide which nearest pub to go to support their group size and book a table to garuntee a table on arrival.
